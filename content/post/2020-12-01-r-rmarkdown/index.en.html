<p>This is an R Markdown sheet generated from the VAERS data. I included some code but for the most part, only figures are shown. I decided to show figures pertaining to Death, Spontaneous abortions, Breakthrough COVID-19 infections and Cardiovascular, Neurological and Immunological adverse events.</p>
<p>I start by coalescing the .csv files downloaded from the VAERS website: <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html</a></p>
<pre><code>## [1] 51068</code></pre>
<p>ACTUAL REPORTED SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) COMPARED TO VAERS STANDARD (15%) - IT IS STILL CONSISTENTLY HIGHER AND PEAKED AT 57%
<img src="Figs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>DISTRIBUTION OF ALL DATA BY AGE GROUP - THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 30 AND 70
<img src="Figs/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" />
NUMBER OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS</p>
<pre><code>## [1] 417</code></pre>
<p>DISTRIBUTION OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS - THIS SUBSET IS GROWING WEEKLY
<img src="Figs/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>THE PLOTS SHOWING OBSERVED VERSUS EXPECTED TRAJECTORIES SHOW CLUSTERING OF DATA AROUND ‘0’ - A LARGER PROPORTION OF REPORTS ARE MADE WITHIN 24 HOURS THAT ONE WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE IF THERE WAS NO CAUSALITY</p>
<p>Plot showing OBSERVED (orange) vs. EXPECTED (yellow) percentages of specific time-frames between Vaccination Date and Miscarriage Date
<img src="Figs/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" />
HEATMAPS ARE BEAUTIFUL WAYS TO ILLUSTRATE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN A SINGLE FIGURE. THESE HEATMAPS SHOW THE INTERSECTIONS OF INJECTION DATES AND ONSET OF ADVERSE EVENT DATES AS PER SPECIFIC AE GROUP. THE COLOR OF THE INTERSECTION ‘BLOCK’ INDICATES THE NUMBER OF INTERSECTIONS THAT OCCURRED - RED = HIGHEST; BLUE = LOWEST. POINTS LYING ON THE DIAGONAL HAVE A CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WHERE R = 1, INDICATING A 1:1 CORRELATION.</p>

<p>THE QUESTION OF DISTRIBUTION BY MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE ANSWERED IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT PFIZER IS ACTUALLY MORE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS - THE PRODUCTS ARE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S. POPULATION SO IT APPEARS AS THOUGH PFIZER IS MORE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS</p>
